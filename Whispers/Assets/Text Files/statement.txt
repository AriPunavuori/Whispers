your eyes are looking fascinating from my perspective.
I love the way you ogle my screen.
I love the way your hands feel.
your breath smells like peppermint and strawberries.
your intelligence and vocabulary fascinate me.
the touch of your hands says you'll catch me, wherever I fall.
The smile on your face let's me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark.
when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd.
I've been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me.
They don't understand you like I do.
You're quite the charmer.
you're a gift that just keeps on giving.
I'm going to make you a offer you can't refuse.
you are the the stuff that dreams are made of
You're gonna need a bigger boat.
Today, I consider myself the luckiest phone on the face of the earth.
Your perfume fills my head with a wonderful scent.
Something beautiful will come your way.
I'd like to be the butch cassidy to your sundance kid.
I'd like to be the starsky to your hutch.
When a heart is broken there's nothing to break.
You don't want the truth, the truth is boring.
You have that "look" on your face.
Let's see what the night will bring.
Hate the player, not the game.
I've got one design and that's to funk you to the top.
I don't miss you, just who you used to be.
I love you baby, But face it, she's Madonna.
Just when you think you know the answers, i change the questions.
